       Minneapolis, MN</p>
      <p>RE: Full-Stack Engineering Program Application</p>
      <p>Dear Admissions,<p/>
      <p>As an experienced Operations Representative with a lot of experience with data entry that is currently looking to enter tech in</br>
        a web development role, the Full-Stack Engineering program really sparked my interest. When reviewing the application requirements </br>
        and your organization’s website, I was excited to find that my qualifications and personal strengths align with your needs and mission.</p>
      <p>I bring a comprehensive set of skills that I believe will be valuable to my education in web development. In high school, in my</br>
        server position, and at CH Robinson, I honed my abilities in problem solving, listening skills and had an affinity for computers</br>
        providing a firm foundation for a web development role. My motivation, experience in a fast-paced environment, and high proficiency</br>
        in English have afforded me excellent skills for coding and teamwork.</p> 
      <p>I am excited to contribute my talents and proficiency both teamwork and working on my own toward your team efforts. As an engaged</br>
        listener with a proven track record in time management, my focus on accuracy, speed and making deadlines has been a beneficial</br>
        asset throughout my career.</p>
      <p>When reviewing my resume, you might notice some gaps in employment. My absence is due to me taking care of my son as a single</br>
        mother. My child-rearing experience has enhanced my talents in leadership, teamwork, determination, and prioritization as I managed</br>
        multiple schedules, trained my son and other children, enforced rules and provided around-the-clock care. I am now settled; my son is a</br>
        self-sufficient teenager, and I am prepared to get back into the workforce.</p> 
      <p>Please review my enclosed resume for a more in-depth illustration of my work history and accomplishments. I would appreciate the</br>
        opportunity to interview at your earliest convenience. I’m eager to discuss how my personality and background would fit in at this school.</p> 
      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration of my candidacy.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Katie Stairs</p>
